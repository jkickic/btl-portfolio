        "<b>SIMULTANEOUS | CONSECUTIVE | WHISPER</b>",
        "When choosing an interpreter, expert knowledge of the subject matter is just as important as interpreting experience. Therefore, we wish to share with you our expertise not only as linguists but also qualified professionals in the areas of Economy and Human Resources. Having worked for world organizations such as the United Nations and multiple global companies, we know how important precision, accuracy, and confidentiality are.",
        "Our goal is to help you succeed in the relations with your clients, so leave the language aspect to us and focus fully on the merits of the matter.",
        "In <b>simultaneous interpreting</b>, the natural flow of the speaker is not disturbed and allows for a smooth experience for listeners, as they don't need to wait in order to understand the message. Simultaneous interpretation is therefore recommended for large-scale conferences and events, where there is no time for the delay in the delivery of the message.",
        "During <b>consecutive interpreting</b> the speaker stops every few minutes after which the interpreter steps in and renders what has just been said to the language of the listeners. Consecutive interpreting involves notetaking (to prevent loss of detail) and is recommended for smaller business meetings.",
        "<b>Whisper interpreting</b> is similar to simultaneous interpreting however, the interpreter doesn't use a microphone or a headset, rather he or she sits next to the person (or a small group) who requires interpreting. This mode is recommended for business meetings where only one person requires interpreting.",
